# Hi!

I'm Lachlan, but when I'm making games I'm Quentin Softpaw, the founder and lead dev of Forest Critter Studios. I have a couple friends helping out where I can, but it's mostly a solo project.

# Violet Sun

Violet Sun is Forest Critter Studios' upcoming debut project. It's a work-in-progress, and I've laid out some of that progress here! The fastest way to get a grips on what the game's up to is to watch these two gameplay update videos I made to share with friends! They're only short.

## Other media
I'm doing all of the programming, 3D modelling, rigging, animations, sound design, shading/rendering, game design, art direction, visual effects, optimisation and level design. Here are visuals!

*That's a custom toon shader! It's really performant.*

There's also a more recent gameplay gif showcasing the newer UI direction, with dynamic resource pickups and feedback on cooldown completion.
